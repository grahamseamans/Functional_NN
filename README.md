# Final Project - Functional Neural Net

to run - `python nn_functional.py`

### Explanation

This is a neural net with parameteriazed size, learning rate, and weight and bias initialization which optimizes using gradient descent. It runs suprisingly fast, and the error isn't terrible with the current hyperparameters (Error mean of ~ 0.01 for a / b where Error = pred - ans, 0 < b < 2000 and 1 < a < b).

It was hard to tell what 'functional' meant in Python. In office hours we decided that using functions, list comprehensions, and recursion was the way to go, so i've implemented this using mostly that toolset.

This ended up being really small! The more time I spent on it and the more 'functional' it became the smaller it got. Now it's down to just two small files. D:
